### Click Automation

Built with pyautogui and pyqt5, this is a tool for automating mouse clicks.
It allows selecting a location and automatically make the cursor click there. The selected location is clicked once every 12 sec, but is easily customizable from the gui.py file.

To help selecting the right location on your screen, the current position of the cursor is tracked and displayed in real time.
